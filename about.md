The Herbarium Information Systems Committee (HISCOM) was established in 1995, making it the longest running sub-committee of the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria (CHAH).

HISCOM has representatives of the computing and information technology programs of each participating institution and deals with the development and application of new technologies to herbarium management, botanical research and information delivery. HISCOMâ€™s flagship project is the [Australasian Virtual Herbarium](https://avh.chah.org.au/).
